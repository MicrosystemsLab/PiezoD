description: Prime the assistant with project guidelines

Read @AGENTS.md carefully and follow all guidelines. Key points:
- Always plan first, share plan for approval before implementing
- Never assume a plan should be implemented without approval, even if bypass permissions is on
- Apply edits yourself after approval
- Don't add functionality without user approval
- Remove old interfaces when refactoring (no legacy baggage)
